  <h1>üóª Ikigai</h1>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Ikigai is the Japanese concept that means "a reason for being." The word refers to having a meaningful direction
      or purpose in life, constituting the sense of one's life being made
      worthwhile, with actions taken toward achieving one's ikigai resulting in satisfaction and a sense of meaning to
      life.

  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Ikigai comes from a combination of two Japanese words: <i>iki</i> referring to life, and <i>kai</i>, which roughly
    means ‚Äúthe realisation
    of what one expects and hopes for‚Äù.
  </p>

  <p>In life there exists four core elements: passion, mission, vocation, and profession. Ikigai is the intersection
    between these four elements.</p>
